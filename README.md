# Call Center Analysis

This is a call center dashboard I created with data from October 2020. It has over 30,000 rows of data.

This Dashboard helps to gain insight on how calls are distributed in each category. Also I filter it by the call centers 
and the date.

Here is how the final dashboard looks like.
